what happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a hidden .git file to start building and saving your commits. You need the repository in order to store the changes made to an exisiting file/files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory shows all the files that have not been committed to a repository and the repository build. Where as the staging area is files that are ready to be committed to the repository. 
I think it's value lies on a holding place to determine whether or not you want to commit that file or files together.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches are helpful when you don't want to alter the master file but want to create a duplicate to make changes for experimental changes etc. Branches enable you to still keep a working
version of the file while also creating another version with changes you have made to see if they work.
